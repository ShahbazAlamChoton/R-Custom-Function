# Convert Data File Type
Often we need to transfer our data (i.e. from dbf to dta) so that we can play it in different statistical software and analyse them
This is a simple conversion tool that change data file extension from one to another. Just write the pattern type of your current data file
and transfer it to desired file type.
# Step:
1. Put your raw data (any type) in the *rawData* folder.
2. Run the Code.
3. Transfered data file will be found ata *dumpData*  folder with the same previous data name.
